This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React. It features a responsive interface where two players take turns marking "X" or "O" on a 3x3 grid. The game detects and announces the winner if a player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). It also includes a draw feature that displays a message when all squares are filled and there's no winner.

The game allows players to:
1. Track the current player (X or O)
2. View the history of moves and jump to any previous point in the game
3. Restart the game at any time
